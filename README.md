# Finding-New-Home-with-Large-Language-Models
In this project, we intend to build a home search recommendation engine. 
Real_estate websites such as Redfin has well-written text desciptions of property on sales. We will utilize the text descriptions and large language models, along with other property-related features such as price, number of rooms, neighborhood safety etc. to construct a home search web app.
Interative_recommendation.py is the Dash/HTML code for the UI web app.
New_Home_Recommendation.ipynb uses BERT to generate text similarity.
Home_Search_Engine.png demonstrates the outlook of the Dash UI.

Please note the project is in its early stage of development and will be continuously updated
