       "\"Here is a description of the property based on the details provided:\\n\\nThis is a condo unit located in Renton. It was built in 1991, so it's an established property but not brand new construction. The condo has an in-unit laundry area with a dryer, which is a nice convenience.\\n\\nThe cost of the condo is $396 per square foot, which would need to be multiplied by the total square footage to determine the sale price. The homeowners association (HOA) fees are $593 per month. HOA fees typically cover maintenance and amenities for the condo complex.\\n\\nThe unit comes with 1 parking space, which is important for condo living. Not having to search for street parking is a major perk.\\n\\nOverall, this seems to be a reasonably priced condo in Renton with good amenities like in-unit laundry and covered parking. The age of just over 30 years old means it's an established complex, while the HOA fees suggest it may have some nice community features and amenities to offset that monthly cost.\""
